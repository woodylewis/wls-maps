# Google Maps API

```
Code challenge - aggregate time: about 2 1/2 hours 

```

Initial process was to get coordinates using the Geocode API.
Clicking the origin button returns the origin coordinates, got the destination values by manually making the call.
No time to do a form for input of any origin location.
2 of the destination coordinate sets returned an undefined value for distance.
Valid distances received are displayed.

The API key will be deleted by Monday, 11/2/15.
